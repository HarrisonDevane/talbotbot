## Model Architecture

Talbotbotâ€™s core is a deep residual CNN inspired by AlphaZero, designed to predict move probabilities and the expected outcome of a position.

- **Input:** 68 feature planes representing the board state and recent move history  
- **Network:**  
  - Initial convolution layer  
  - 20 residual blocks with batch normalization and ReLU activations  
  - Dropout applied from block 10 onwards to improve generalization  
- **Outputs:**  
  - **Policy head:** predicts probabilities for 4672 possible moves  
  - **Value head:** predicts the positionâ€™s expected outcome as a number between âˆ’1 (loss) and +1 (win)

## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

Talbotbot uses MCTS to explore possible moves by simulating games and using the neural networkâ€™s policy and value predictions to guide search efficiently. This helps balance exploration of new moves with exploitation of strong known moves, improving decision-making during play.

## Training Data

Talbotbot v1.5 was trained with supervised learning on diverse datasets, including:

- 20 million positions from Grandmaster games  
- 5 million positions from Lichess games rated 2600+  
- 2 million tactical positions  
- 2 million synthetic endgame positions (random legal setups with 3â€“7 pieces)

Positions are labeled using quick Stockfish evaluations (~0.02 seconds per position) and corresponding moves from games or engine analysis. For snapshot positions (tactics, endgames), prior states are reconstructed by playing moves backward.
